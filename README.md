# Login and Register Module Practice Project

This project is my personal attempt in getting my hands dirty on the server side for the basic account registration and login.

The entire source file is developed using Vite + React, SCSS for the client side while using NodeJS, MySQL to set up a server to get the input from the account registration and also compare the existing account from the database to decide whether to approve the login or not.
